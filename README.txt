Python code for reading raw HID packets from a LS2208 (and similar?) USB barcode scanner. Windows only, hopefully someone can adapt HID code for linux/mac? 

VID/PID hardcoded, change if necessary for other scanners

Requires win32 extension for Python. Tested with python 2.5 only. May not work with other versions.
